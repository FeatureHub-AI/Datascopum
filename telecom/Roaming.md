# **Roaming**

**Idea behind**

Roaming category includes features that are related to the ability of a mobile device to connect to a network outside of its home network. Roaming allows users to stay connected to the internet and make calls even when they are outside of their home network's coverage area. 

Roaming services can be expensive, and as a result, subscribers who use roaming services often have different characteristics than those who do not. Typically, subscribers who use roaming services are frequent travelers, either for business or pleasure, who need to stay connected while outside of their home network's coverage area. Roaming usage can also be an indicator of a subscriber's financial capacity, as roaming services are typically more expensive than regular services, and may require a higher level of disposable income.

However, it is also worth noting that many subscribers may choose to restrict their usage of roaming services due to the high costs associated with it. As a result, a lack of roaming usage may not necessarily be an indicator of a subscriber's lack of financial capacity or travel habits. Rather, it may simply indicate a preference to avoid the high costs associated with roaming services.

**Data source**

Call Detail Record (CDR).

For roaming calls, the CDRs would also contain information about the location of the calling party at the time of the call, as well as information about the visited network that the calling party was connected to while roaming.

## Duration of incoming roaming network events, percentile

We use the percentile to help the model to understand better the distribution of a dataset and how a particular value compares to the rest of our dataset. 

In telecom we are usually looking into 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th and 95th.

# OCRM Services 

**Idea behind**

The number of all active services refers to the total number of services that were connected through app, site (personal space), office or call center. This feature can be used as a way to understand the level of engagement of a subscriber with a telecom company, and to identify potential upselling or cross-selling opportunities. Overall the idea is that the more active services subscribers have, the more engaged, reliant and advanced customers they are.

**Data source** 

Some possible data sources include:

- SRVO / SRVP datasets: with all permanent, temporary or one-time services activation statuses
- Billing systems: Telecommunications companies typically have a billing system that tracks subscriber information, including the date of the last monthly fee charge and the date of the next charge.
- CRM systems: Telecommunications companies may also use a customer relationship management (CRM) system that stores subscriber information, including billing information.

**Idea behind**

Operator offers many distinctive services for their customers, the main among them are SMS, Voice, Data usage. We would like to know the magnitude of usage of all potentially available services for a customer.

**Data source**

You will need a network service usage dataset, which will include sms, voice and data sessions. You can merge or append them for your calculations if they are stored separately.

## Count of events of usage of all network services

**TRAF_ALL_CNT_W1**:	The number of all network events, week 1

**TRAF_ALL_CNT_W2**:	The number of all network events, week 2

**TRAF_ALL_CNT_W3**:	The number of all network events, week 3

**TRAF_ALL_CNT_W4**:	The number of all network events, week 4

**TRAF_ALL_CNT_4W**:	the number of all network events, in 4 weeks

**TRAF_ALL_CNT_M1**:	The number of all network events, month 1

**TRAF_ALL_CNT_M2**:	The number of all network events, month 2

**TRAF_ALL_CNT_M3**:	The number of all network events, month 3

**TRAF_ALL_CNT_3M**:	the number of all network events, in 3 months

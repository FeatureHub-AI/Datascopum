# Tariff plan change

**Idea behind** 

Choosing a tariff plan is typically a deliberate decision, where customers are expected to understand their usage patterns and select a plan that meets their needs. However, changes to usage patterns can occur over time, prompting customers to seek a different set of features or a more suitable pricing plan. The change can be initiated either by subscriber, paid or free or by provider. By analysing these features we can try to understand how this change influences his future behaviour, choices and satisfaction with services.

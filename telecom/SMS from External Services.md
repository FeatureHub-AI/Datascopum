**Idea behind** 

In today's modern era, smartphones have become an integral part of our daily lives. They are no longer just devices to make phone calls and send text messages, but have evolved into powerful tools that enable us to perform a plethora of tasks. From shopping online to banking, our phones have become an all-in-one solution for our everyday needs. Subscribers utilize their phones not only to stay connected with others but also for various purposes such as shopping, receiving updates from banks, and utilizing two-factor authentication. SMS messages from external services can serve as an indicator of a tech-savvy and engaged subscriber who values convenience and strives to stay up-to-date.

**Data source**

The SMSC logs all incoming messages, including the time they were received, the sender's phone number.

## Number of incoming SMS from bank

The fact that a subscriber has connected essential daily services to a particular phone number can serve as an indicator of their engagement. In the event of a sudden lack of SMS notifications from financial services, this could be a cause for concern, as it suggests that the customer may have switched their services to a different phone number rather than stopped using them altogether.

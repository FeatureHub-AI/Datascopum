# **Number of previous loans**

Provides information about the borrower's credit history and their experience in managing credit

## **The idea behind**

Borrowers with a higher number of previous loans may be seen as less risky because they have a proven track record of repaying loans.

## **Methodology**

To create this feature, we count the number of previous loans that a customer has taken out.

### **Data source**

The data used to create this feature is taken from the Home Credit Default Risk competition on Kaggle. Specifically, we use the **`previous_application.csv`** file, which contains information about previous applications for loans at Home Credit. We use the following columns from the file:

- **`SK_ID_CURR`**: ID of the borrower
- **`SK_ID_PREV`**: ID of the previous loan

Here is an example table showing the first 10 rows of the **`previous_application.csv`** file:

| SK_ID_CURR | SK_ID_PREV |
| --- | --- |
| 100002 | 1369693 |
| 100003 | 1038818 |
| 100003 | 1810518 |
| 100003 | 2636178 |
| 100003 | 2396755 |
| 100004 | 1564014 |
| 100006 | 2078043 |
| 100006 | 2827850 |
| 100006 | 2190416 |
| 100006 | 1489396 |

### **SQL code**

To assemble the feature, we use the following SQL code:

```sql

SELECT SK_ID_CURR, COUNT(DISTINCT SK_ID_PREV) AS PREVIOUS_LOANS_CNT
FROM previous_application
GROUP BY SK_ID_CURR
```

### **Result table (example of how to calculate the feature)**

Here is an example table showing how the feature is assembled for the first 10 customers:

| SK_ID_CURR | PREVIOUS_LOANS_CNT |
| --- | --- |
| 100002 | 1 |
| 100003 | 4 |
| 100004 | 1 |
| 100006 | 4 |

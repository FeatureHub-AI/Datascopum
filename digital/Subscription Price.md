# **Subscription Price**

The cost of a recurring subscription for a product or service.

## **The idea behind**

The subscription price has a direct impact on the revenue generated from each user, which in turn can significantly affect the overall profitability of the app. This feature also has an effect on user behavior and engagement, as the price point can influence how invested users feel in the app. This psychological factor can be a major determinant in a user's decision to prolong or cancel their subscription.

Moreover, the subscription price can also impact the perceived value and quality of the app. The price point is strongly associated with the app or service's quality and can significantly influence a user's choices.

## **Methodology**

This feature can be calculated simply by retrieving the subscription price from the relevant data source.

### **Data source**

The data source for this feature would typically be a database or file that contains information about the app's subscription pricing. Here is an example table:

| User ID | Subscription Price |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 4.99 |
| 2 | 9.99 |
| 3 | 14.99 |
| 4 | 19.99 |
| 5 | 24.99 |
| 6 | 29.99 |
| 7 | 34.99 |
| 8 | 39.99 |
| 9 | 44.99 |
| 10 | 49.99 |

### **SQL code**

To retrieve the subscription price from the data source, we can use the following SQL code:

```sql
sqlCopy code
SELECT subscription_price FROM subscription_table WHERE user_id = [user_id];

```

Where **`subscription_table`** is the name of the table in the data source, and **`[user_id]`** is the user ID for the relevant user.

### **Result table (example of how to calculate the feature)**

Here is an example table that shows how the Subscription Price feature can be calculated using the data source and SQL code provided above:

| User ID | Subscription Price | Subscription Price (Feature) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 4.99 | 4.99 |
| 2 | 9.99 | 9.99 |

| 5 | 24.99 | 24.99 |
| 6 | 29.99 | 29.99 |
| 7 | 34.99 | 34.99 |
| 8 | 39.99 | 39.99 |
| 9 | 44.99 | 44.99 |

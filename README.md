## Introduction

Dear Data Science Community,

We're excited to introduce our new project FeatureHub started by the analytical & consulting team of Datascopum aimed at creating the most comprehensive library of AI/ML features across multiple domains. Our goal is to create a dataset that serves as a valuable resource for researchers and data scientists worldwide.

We invite all data scientists to contribute to this project, leveraging their expertise to create a dataset that covers a wide range of topics and applications. Together, we can create something remarkable that benefits the entire data science community.

If you're interested in contributing, please check our [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/FeatureHub-AI/Datascopum/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md). We look forward to working with you to create a dataset that serves as the foundation for countless research projects and innovations.

We want you to have fun and enjoy being part of our community. It is a great opportunity for collaboration, learning, and growth. 
So don't hesitate to contribute!

## Getting Started
### Contributor Guidelines:

To ensure a professional and enjoyable community experience, we ask that you familiarize yourself with the following rules before posting:

+ Please use Markdown (.md) files to format your content.
+ Our community folders are organized by industry (e.g. telecom, finance, e-commerce)
+ New machine learning features should include a clear idea behind and methodology for construction. The idea should explain why the feature is important, while the methodology should describe the calculation process and data sources. Including code and data can aid replication and validation efforts. This information will allow other researchers to understand the feature's purpose and validate its results, ultimately contributing to the advancement of the field.  
+ Here you can find an [example feature](https://github.com/FeatureHub-AI/FeatureHub/blob/main/FEATURE_EXAMPLE.md) to help guide your submissions.


### Technical Guidelines:

To submit your material, follow these steps:

+ Add/edit your material.
+ Commit your changes.
+ Submit a pull request (PR).
+ Await approval from the repository owners.
